    description: "The original Audi e-tron was the brand's first mass-produced fully electric vehicle, taking the form of a mid-size luxury SUV. Built on a modified MLB Evo platform, it featured dual electric motors providing quattro all-wheel drive with a total output of up to 402 HP in boost mode. The 95 kWh battery delivered a range of approximately 220-250 miles (depending on the version and test cycle). The e-tron pioneered features like optional virtual side mirrors using cameras and displays, and was capable of 150 kW DC fast charging. The lineup expanded to include the e-tron Sportback with a more coupe-like roofline. The original e-tron established Audi's electric vehicle design language and technology foundation before being renamed Q8 e-tron in 2023 for its major update."
